# 🛍️ Complete Ecommerce Shop Integration

This template now includes a **complete working ecommerce system** copied from the zylo storefront implementation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the template**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit the test page**: http://localhost:3000/test-shop
3. **Test the shop**: http://localhost:3000/shop

## 📁 What's Included

### Complete Shop System
- **`/app/shop/page.tsx`** - Main shop page with product grid, filtering, search, collections
- **`/app/shop/[productId]/page.tsx`** - Individual product detail pages with checkout
- **`/app/checkout/success/page.tsx`** - Order confirmation and tracking
- **`/app/shop/components/`** - All supporting components (StorefrontProductCard, etc.)

### Test & Demo Pages
- **`/app/test-shop/page.tsx`** - Test page to verify configuration and functionality
- **`/app/page.tsx`** - Updated homepage with links to shop system

## 🔧 Configuration

The shop system uses existing environment variables from `.env`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID=hw8u8FgXeBcQGo9CRezTWmEivX92
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The shop system makes calls to these endpoints:

- `GET /api/tenant/products` - Fetch products for shop grid
- `GET /api/tenant/collections` - Fetch collections for filtering  
- `GET /api/storefront/{tenantId}/products/{productId}` - Individual product details
- `POST /api/storefront/{tenantId}/checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/storefront/{tenantId}/orders/create-from-checkout` - Create order from checkout

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

The components registry has been updated so AI agents will automatically use this complete shop system when they detect ecommerce needs:

- **`ShopPage`** - For any product/shop/store pages
- **`ShopProductDetailPage`** - For individual product pages  
- **`CheckoutSuccessPage`** - For order confirmation

AI agents will copy the complete working files (not abstract components) to preserve all functionality.

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Environment Check**: Visit `/test-shop` to verify configuration
2. **Shop Functionality**: Visit `/shop` to test the complete storefront
3. **Product Details**: Click any product to test detail pages
4. **Checkout Flow**: Test the complete purchase flow (requires API)

## 🔄 Complete Ecommerce Flow

1. **Browse** → `/shop` (product grid, filtering, search)
2. **View Product** → `/shop/[productId]` (detailed view, variants, checkout)
3. **Purchase** → Stripe checkout integration
4. **Confirmation** → `/checkout/success` (order tracking)

## 📝 Notes

- This is a **complete working system** with real API integration
- All functionality from the zylo storefront is preserved
- The system is theme-agnostic - AI agents can customize appearance while preserving functionality
- No Firebase auth required - uses environment variables for tenant ID
- Ready for production use with proper API backend
